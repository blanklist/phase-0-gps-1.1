GPS 1.1 Reflection

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Prior to the GPS session, I was struggling with pulling repos down from GitHub and pushing my changes.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The GPS helped me to understand better how to create a pull request when working with another user (i.e. when not making a pull request and merging my own changes). 

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my guide a few questions about pushing my changes to Joe's repo on GitHub.

4. What still confuses you about Git?

I'm still a bit shaky with working with multiple people on a repo. I find I can pull, push, and merge just fine with my own code, but when it comes to cloning other people's repositories to my own computer and making the directory for those files, I'm still a bit shaky. I think I'll be a lot more comfortable with this after 1-2 more pairing sessions.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great! I loved having a mentor there to guide us when we needed help. Joe and I were able to get through the session by ourselves for the most part, but when we got stuck Kit was there to jump in and offer advice. I like how he didn't just tell us the answers - he guided us so we could reach the solution on our own.
